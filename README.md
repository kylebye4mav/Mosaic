# Mosaic

Mosaic: This project utilizes Swing Components in Java to host an application
        capable of showing a 12 by 12 interactable grid of tiles with random
        shapes and letters that can randomize if the "randomize" button is clicked
        along with change the tile to a face if the tile is clicked upon.

Build Instructons:

    1)  Change Directory to the file with that contains the main method. In other words,
        make sure you are in the same file that "Mosaic.java" is in.

    2)  Utilize "javac *.java"

        a)  Double check in the "shapes" folder that every file in there is compiled. If not,
            Change Directory to the "shapes" folder and call the same command. Back directory
            out afterwards.

    3)  Run the program using "java Mosaic".

Notes about Runtime:

    1)  Every time all the tiles are going to be repainted,
        "Start paint ***" is written in the console.
    
    2)  Every time each tile gets painted, a block of text containing
        info about every attribute of the MosaicTile instance is printed
        in the console seperated by line separators.
